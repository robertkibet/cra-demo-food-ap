# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Users in a Food store
This is a React implementation for a users listing for a food store. It consumes apis from [rapidapi](https://rapidapi.com/shashwath-KR/api/fake-users7/) to demonstrate approaches with React context api and emotion-js styled components.
